          We recognized this long before the pandemic. Even then, we were aware
          that millions of Indians faced overwhelming healthcare costs, with
          only a few having insurance to protect them during medical crises. We
          saw how a single critical illness could wipe out a family's life
          savings, often trapping them in debt for years. Shockingly, over 50
          million Indians have already been pushed into poverty due to medical
          expenses.

          This is why we launched Sanyogita Trust—to offer a compassionate,
          community-driven way to support those facing life-threatening
          illnesses and to empower individuals to extend a helping hand to those
          in need.

          Today, we understand this reality even more deeply. We know that
          accessible healthcare financing is not a privilege but a necessity,
          that medical emergencies are more frequent than we assume, and that no
          one is immune to financial hardship. That’s why we are evolving beyond
          just a platform—we are building solutions that can help a struggling
          farmer save his newborn just as much as they can support a doctor
          fighting to afford his wife’s cancer treatment.

            Sanyogati is dedicated to supporting a wide range of causes, from
            nonprofit initiatives to personal and creative endeavors. However,
            in today's post-pandemic world, access to healthcare funding is not
            just important—it is essential. No one should have to choose between
            financial stability and life-saving treatment. At Sanyogati, we
            believe healthcare financing must be a priority, ensuring that help
            reaches those in need when they need it most.
